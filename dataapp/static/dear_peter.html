Dear Peter,

You have become the laughing stock of the intelligence community. Your claim to victory in pompompurin's arrest and subsequent embarrassment was one of the best things I've ever witnessed. You have shown to *EVERYONE* that you are a man-child, and not someone that can be taken seriously. I find the fact that you gather leaked data and sell it to the masses for thousands of dollars rather comical.

I continue to host this search engine just to spite you, and I will continue to do so as long as I am financially able to.

In case you are wondering, the initial investment cost me arround $1,000 USD, and ongoing costs are arround $50/month, nowhere near your outrageous pricing. This site was created by one person, not a team like you have. 

Best Regards,
Miyako

Hi,

Just tried calling you - thanks for informing us! Crisis averted!

I'm curios to know how you found the domain breach.industries?

Regards and thanks again,

Hello, there was an intelx API key partially leaked along with an individual trying to use your API to create a website with the same functions.

Leaked : $api-&gt;setApiKey('dbf88656-f0a4-4b57-b89c-');
Website: https://breach.industries/index.html

&gt; the same individual is going to try this method again and scrape all databases in order to create the site, rather than basing it off of an API key since we had some contact

Again thanks for the info. Can you please share more details? Which API endpoint is it, what is the method?

We are happy to provide you a free Professional account for reporting this.

Regards,

Peter

I came across this breach when I was looking to gain access to your API for free, since there were errors in the code, allowing me to gain partial access to the full version without paying. I also know the same individual is going to try this method again and scrape all databases in order to create the site, rather than basing it off of an API key since we had some contact.
